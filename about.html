     <span>
      Community Change is a national organization that builds power from
      the ground up, the name also serves as a sentence of our purpose. We believe that effective and enduring social
      movements must be led by those most impacted by injustice
      themselves. Since our founding in 1968, we have built the power of
      people most marginalized by injustice — especially people of
      color, women, immigrants, people struggling to make ends meet — to
      envision and fight for a society where all communities thrive. We
      are Equity-driven policy that focuses the government’s power on
      fostering dramatically more fairness in the distribution of wealth
      and on checking corporate power.
      <p>Our goal is to dramatically improve material conditions for people struggling to make ends meet in the United States, and we have a 15-year plan to do so. Our role is to fuse the power of organized people, bold ideas, and political clout — a three-dimensional power that we believe is the recipe for an economy and democracy where everyone has the freedom to thrive.</p>

     <p class="title">When Did We Get Started?</p>
     <p>
      Founded in 1968 Our founders’ vision and their charge—to build
      power through grassroots leadership, to challenge the government
      to be a force for good, to focus on poor people, especially poor
      people of color—are just as relevant today as at the time of our
      birth.
     </p>
     <p>
      In over 50 years of organizing and advocation we have won
      significant anti-poverty victories including: Major new
      investments in affordable housing; Expansions of refundable child
      tax credits and the food stamps program; Policy changes that drove
      billions of dollars of private investment to communities of color;
      Good jobs at scale delivered by new models of organizing and
      campaigns. Helped mobilize millions of people to win Obamacare and
      defend the social safety net from radical attacks.

     <p class="title">Why Do We Do It?</p>
     <p>
      Our mission is to build the power and capacity of low-income
      people, especially low-income people of color, to change the
      policies and institutions that impact their lives.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our strategy is to create the conditions for transformational
      change that moves us in the direction of justice, equity, and an
      inclusive democracy and economy. That vision requires: People
      power that resides in Black, brown, and immigrant communities;
      Community organizing models capable of engaging directly affected
      people at scale; A bold governing agenda rooted in a new common
      sense for our political economy; An electorate that looks more
      like the country.
